## General info
This project uses HTML and CSS to create a static webpage containing a working table of contents comprised of hyperlinks, and tables of commonly used HTML and CSS language. I will be continually adding to this page as my knowledge on the subjects expands, as this page can be a reference point written in language I know how to understand.
